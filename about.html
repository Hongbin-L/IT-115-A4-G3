    <p><font size="4" style="line-height:2;">Bars in capitol hill had a couple things in common, its that they have plenty of options for their clientele as well as they stay open late almost to the morning.<br>One of my favorite bars in Capitol hill was the Garage right on Broadway. What I liked about Garage was the long list of drink options and the food menu Plus the pool option they had for entertainment. And due to having a couple friends who lived in that street and area. I spent most of my weekendâ€™s nights there. We would start our night at Garage bar then by midnight we would walk down the street for couple blocks to a place called Q nightclub. Which is also a good bar that would close around 3am. What I liked about that area is how we could park in one spot and could visit 2 or 3 bars that are walking distance from each other.<br>Also parking was very convenient in Capitol Hill, there were many paid parking areas including the Seattle Central College parking lot that turns to a public paid parking in the weekend to provide more parking space for visitors from outside of town.</font></p>
