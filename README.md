Paragraph:
Bars in capitol hill had a couple things in common, its that they have plenty of options for their clientele as well as they stay open late almost to the morning.
One of my favorite bars in Capitol hill was the Garage right on Broadway. What I liked about Garage was the long list of drink options and the food menu Plus the pool option they had for entertainment. And due to having a couple friends who lived in that street and area. I spent most of my weekendâ€™s nights there. We would start our night at Garage bar then by midnight we would walk down the street for couple blocks to a place called Q nightclub. Which is also a good bar that would close around 3am. What I liked about that area is how we could park in one spot and could visit 2 or 3 bars that are walking distance from each other.
Also parking was very convenient in Capitol Hill, there were many paid parking areas including the Seattle Central College parking lot that turns to a public paid parking in the weekend to provide more parking space for visitors from outside of town.
